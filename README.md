# Hello!

### These are the shell scripts I have written to save myself clicking here and there for the tasks I do daily

- Save these files on your computer (preferably Desktop folder) and you can run them by double clicking them after you have followed the below mentioned steps
- Don't forget to make the file executable by using the command

```
chmod +x playOverlord.sh
```

- In your file manager menu, You may also need to tell your system to run the file instead of opening it in a text editor by
  1. Go to `Preferences->Behavious->Executable Text Files`
  2. Select the `Run them` option instead of `Display them`
