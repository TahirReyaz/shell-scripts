# Hello!

### These are the shell scripts I have written to save myself clicking here and there for the tasks I do daily

- Save these files on your computer (preferably Desktop folder) and you can run them by double clicking them after you have followed the below mentioned steps
- The path I keep files on may differ from yours, so edit that too
- Don't forget to make the file executable by using the following command in the terminal (Make sure to be in the same directory as your script or provide correct path in the command)

```
chmod +x playOverlord.sh
```

- In your file manager menu, You may also need to tell your system to run the file instead of opening it in a text editor by
  1. Going to `Preferences->Behavious->Executable Text Files`
  2. Selecting the `Run them` option instead of `Display them`
